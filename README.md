Overview of the project:

PROJECT: TEMPERATURE CONVERTER

OBJECTIVE:
      The objective of this code is to create a temperature converter program that can convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
      
KEY ACTIVITIES:

      1. The program prompts the user to select the type of temperature conversion they want to perform.
      
      2. The user is asked to enter the temperature value to be converted.
      
      3. The program calls the convertTemperature function to perform the temperature conversion based on the user's selection.
      
      4. The converted temperature value is displayed to the user along with the original temperature value and the units of measurement.

TECHNOLOGY USED:
     1.Programming Language: C
     
     2. Development Environment: Any C compiler (e.g., GCC)
     3. Input/Output: Standard input/output functions in C (scanf, printf)
     4. Data Structures: None (simple variables and arrays are used)
     5. Algorithms: Simple arithmetic operations are used for temperatureÂ conversion.
